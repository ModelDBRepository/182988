TRPM8-DEPENDENT DYNAMIC RESPONSE IN A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF COLD

Neuron folder
-------------

After compiling the supplied .mod files, run mosinit.hoc. A graphical
interface will allow to run 5 parameter combinations with 2 different
temperature protocols: cold/heat pulse and cold pulse+temperature
steps.  Voltage trace, firing rate and Interspike-Intervals are
plotted.

The cold/heat pulse (default simulation) is a mix of Figures 1C and 2B
from the paper:

Note that temperature protocols are not identical because the Figures
in the paper are done with real temperature recordings while the
simulation produces an idealized trace.

Python folder
-------------
The script 'main.py' will produce a short voltage trace for 34, 30, 26
and 22 degrees C and a firing rate/ISI plot in response to cold and
hot pulses.

The second simulation is a mix of Figures 1C and 2B from the paper
with idealized temperature trace. Change the ParamSet option in lines
182 and/or 191 to explore the behavior of different parameter sets.

Both the Neuron and Python codes consider a period of adaptation in which the 
dynamics of TRPM8 desensitization is transienlty accelerated.
